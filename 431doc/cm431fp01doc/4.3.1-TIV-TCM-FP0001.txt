Inventory software scan returns access time information - Feature 
MR0808085933
         With this feature, if you perform an Inventory software scan,
         configured using the Scan for installed products using
         signature matching scan option, you retrieve new information
         named ACCESSED TIME, which shows the GMT time when the
         signature file was last accessed.

Exclude history tables - Feature 235414
         With this feature you can now exclude the history processing of
         some tables, to improve performance when loading the scan
         results into the database. All the Inventory tables that
         contain the COMPUTER_SYS_ID attribute have history data
         collected.

         If you have Inventory tables for which you do not need to keep
         the history tables, perform the following steps:
         1. Create the EXCLUDED_H_TABLES table.
         2. Insert the name of the table to be excluded in
            EXCLUDED_H_TABLES.

         You can find the SQL statements for performing these operations
         in the h_inv_dbvendor_schema_431_FP01.sql script file.


WUA 3.0 support
         With this feature the support has been extended to WUA version
         3.0 for the Patch Management component.

         If you have installed WUA 3.0, perform the following steps
         before using the new WUA version:
         1. Locate and open the WUA.spd file.
         2. Replace, for example, all WindowsUpdateAgent20-x86.exe
            occurrences in the file with the following file name: 
            WindowsUpdateAgent30-x86.exe

         For more details about the WUA 3.0 support, see also the 2.1.4,
         "Limitations" section.


Discovery Library Adapter (DLA) version 7.1.-TCMDLA-I
         The new version of the Discovery Library Adapter (DLA) for
         Tivoli Configuration Manager has been published on the OPAL Web
         site and replaces older versions.

         This DLA provides resource instance and resource relationship
         instance information for the Tivoli Configuration Manager
         according to the IDML specification using a lightweight,
         easy-to-use solution based on IBM Tivoli Director Integrator.


Windows 7 and SLES 11 endpoint support 
         The endpoint support has now been extended to endpoints having
         the following operating systems installed: 
         *  Windows 7
         *  SLES 11

         Note: To enable WSUS 3.0 to manage Windows 7 endpoints for
               Patch Management operations, you must download the
               Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2 from the following
               Microsoft Web site:

               http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=a206ae20-2695-436c-9578-3403a7d46e40


Windows 2008 r2 platform support
         The support has now been extended to Tivoli servers and
         endpoints with the Windows 2008 r2 operating system installed.

         Note: To enable WSUS 3.0 to manage Windows 2008 r2 endpoints
               for Patch Management operations, you must download the
               Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2 from the following
               Microsoft Web site:

               http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=a206ae20-2695-436c-9578-3403a7d46e40

2.1.3 Product compatibility

Compatibility is defined as whether different versions of a Tivoli
product can communicate with different versions of Tivoli Management
Framework or other Tivoli products.

IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager, Version 4.3.1 fix pack
4.3.1.-TIV-TCM-FP0001 was tested using:
*  Tivoli Management Framework, Version 4.3.1.
*  Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Software, version 5.1.1.

2.1.4 Limitations

Defect 66833: Emergency patches are not installable on Windows 7
endpoints.

Defect 59806: A patch installation might fail with exit code 1641. The
workstation is automatically rebooted and the patch installation is
completed when the workstation restarts. If the patch installation was
performed using an activity plan, also the activity plan fails. Use the
wsecrprt command to verify the patch installation.

Defect 59828: An activity plan for installing Microsoft service packs
might fail. In the Software Distribution log file, one or more patches,
contained in the service pack, fail with exit code 1642. This exit code
does not mean that the service pack installation has failed, it means
that the specific patch is not needed because the specific software
module you are trying to upgrade is not present.

Defect 59811: The "2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 1"
installation fails. If you perform a query in Patch Management using the
wsecrprt command, the patch is missing. Despite this error, in most
cases the patch has been installed correctly. Verify the patch
installation from the Add or Remove Programs list of the Windows
operating system. A ticket has been opened to Microsoft for this
software limitation.

APAR IY88658: The SSL connection is not supported for the Enterprise
Directory Query component.

Defect 58552: When running an activity plan to install a patch on a
Windows 2000 Advanced Server, the patch installation might fail with
exit code 1. The problem is generated by how parameters are parsed by
the operating system.

As a workaround to successfully install the patch, you must modify the
inhibit_parsing key. Inhibit parsing prevents the standard parsing of
the values passed to the patch installation script. To modify the value
of the inhibit_parsing key, perform the following steps:
1. In the Patch Management policy region, locate the patch that you are
   trying to install and unbuild it by converting the software package
2. Launch the Software Package Editor and edit the Execute Program
   object named $(temp_dir)\Hotfix\$(EXE)
3. Select Advanced
4. Clear the Inhibit Parsing check box
5. Save and close the modified software package
6. Rebuild the software package by converting it
7. Distribute the software package only to the endpoints on which the
   distribution failed previously.

Refer to the IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager: Reference Manual for
Software Distribution and IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager: User's Guide
for Software Distribution for more information about the inhibit parsing
option.

Defect 201407: If the Common Inventory Technology (CIT) package is
installed on the endpoint in transactional mode, and the following
commit operation is not performed or fails, a subsequent transactional
installation of the same package fails with RC=10.

To avoid this problem, before installing CIT, you must perform the
commit operation or manually uninstall CIT. This problem often occurs
when you install CIT by using an inventory scan.

Defect 181204: When you distribute a hardware scan profile to a Windows®
2003 with an AMD Opteron processor, the processor being detected is
incorrect. It results in "Pentium® M" instead of "AMD Opteron Family"
because of a Microsoft® problem.

Defect 58827: Messages sent to the Activity Plan Monitor and stored in
the activity plan database are truncated if their length is greater than
the length defined in the schema. All the messages, except for Tivoli
Provisioning Manager for Operating System Deployment messages, are
truncated at the end. The Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Operating
System Deployment messages are truncated at the beginning because they
start with the copyright information, which is not useful for the error
explanation.

2.1.5 Internationalization limitations

Defect 58877: Messages displayed in Error Messages when you monitor an
IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Operating System Deployment plan, by
selecting a target and then Show/Hide Details from the pull-down menu of
the Activity Plan Monitor GUI, are sometimes in English.

Defect 58757: The Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Operating System
Deployment messages that are displayed in the Activity Plan Monitor
after you submit a plan are garbled. Workaround: You can either change
the language of Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Operating System
Deployment to English or open the rbagent.log log and search for the
corresponding error message.

Defect 58916: When a DB2 error occurs on Tivoli Provisioning Manager for
Operating System Deployment in non-English environment, the DB2 error
message shown in Activity Plan Monitor might be garbled. This is a known
problem of IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for Operating System
Deployment Fix Pack 1. To identify the error, look for the DB2 message
ID and SQL code in the DB2 message reference.

Error Description:
         A signature software scan can find files having a zero (0) file
         size. However, the MATCH_SWARE_VIEW that joins the SIGNATURE
         table with UNMATCHED_FILES, which represents the results of the
         file system scan named "Scan for Basic Information", does not
         display any match for signature files having size 0, even if

Error Description:
         The value for the Inventory hardware scan data OS_SUB_VERS,
         named "Sub Version" in the MIF file, is limited to 32
         characters, but, for example, the result data for the polish
         Microsoft Windows XP Professional service pack 1 is 35
         characters long. The following is a sample tivhscan.mif file:

Abstract: 
         The 20081130 catalog file causes an Inventory scan failure

Error Description:
         If you have downloaded the catalog named 
         itlcm22-allProducts-fullSwCat-20081130.xml

         and you have run one of these commands: 
         *  winvmigrate -c itlcm22-allProducts-fullSwCat-20081130.xml
         *  winvsig -a -f itlcm22-allProducts-fullSwCat-20081130.xml

         when you perform an Inventory scan against a Windows endpoint
         the scan fails.

Additional information:
         The scan failure is caused by an incorrect signature in the
         catalogWindows.txt file, which is downloaded on the endpoint.
         The reason is that the Configuration Manager scanner does not
         accept an extended signature that is split into multiple rows: 
         42987]57b056a4abfe46c0b480d883136ada59]0]400]1]&nil;]

Error Description:
         If you install the Tivoli desktop from Configuration Manager
         4.3.1 CD 3 and specify a non-default installation path such as
         c:\tivoli\desktop, when you try to launch the inventory editor
         GUI it does not launch. A hard-coded issue is present in the
         file c:\Tivoli\Desktop\Console\InvGUI.bat. The suggested
         workaround for this issue is to change the path to match your
         non-default installation path.

Error Description:
         When running big Inventory scans, deadlocks can be found in the
         RIM log for the PRINTER and MOUSE tables.

Additional Information:
         The PRINTER and MOUSE tables are leaf tables (no
         computer_sys_id) so they can be concurrently accessed by
         different output threads.

Error Description:
         When the catalog of the signatures is not downloaded, the log
         file shows that wscanner tried to run but does not specify that
         the problem is caused by a missing catalog. A more specific log

         even if the Inventory profile is not configured to scan for
         signatures. The same issue occurs on UNIX platforms.

APAR IZ52869 

Abstract: 
         Log file specified with wsetinvglobal must allow you to specify

Error Description:
         You must be able to specify what the permissions are in the log
         file specified when running the wsetinvglobal command. These
         permissions were modified into 666 nobody:esms with APAR

APAR IZ53428 

Abstract: 
         $remote keyword not working if preceeded by "/"

Error Description:
         Common Inventory Technology (CIT) provides the capability to
         scan a remote drive if it is preceded by the $REMOTE:: key. The
         Inventory server and the wsetinvpcfiles / wsetinvunixfiles
         commands add a / prefix to all the directory names specified in
         the Include Directory section. CIT cannot read this key. 

         The following fix applies to UNIX endpoints only:

         The Tivoli Configuration Manager code has been modified, so
         that the "/" prefix is not added, if the "$REMOTE" string is
         located at the beginning of the directory name.


Additional Information:
         Even if the $REMOTE prefix is correctly set, the scan against a
         remote drive might not work, in particular on Windows
         platforms, because the remote drive might not be visible to the
         TRAA (wlcftap) TMF user, when it invokes any command. For
         example, when running a simple TMF task such as:
         ls -la N:/

         where N:/ is a remote resource, the scan might not work.

Abstract: 
         ACCESSED TIME information is now provided by the tivsscan.mif

Error Description:
         If you perform an Inventory software scan, configured using the
         Scan for installed products using signature matching scan
         option, you retrieve new information named ACCESSED TIME, which
         shows the GMT time when the signature file was last accessed.

Additional Information:
         The software signature scan on the endpoint now discovers the
         ACCESSED TIME information for each matched signature. On the
         endpoint, the inv/SCAN/tivsscan.mif file now shows this
         information. The INVENTORY_SWARE and H_INVENTORY_SWARE queries
         have been updated to display the new column. Also the
         INST_SWARE_VIEW and H_INST_SWARE_VIEW have been modified.

         the Managed Node or the Path to file parameter. Check whether the
         managed node and file name exist and have been entered correctly.

         The problem is that the file exists, it is valid, and it has
         the correct permissions. Therefore, traces are needed to
         understand what the problem is.

To upgrade large environments, start installing the fix pack on the
Tivoli gateways. If you cannot install the fix pack on the Tivoli server
and all the gateways at the same time, to ensure that all gateways keep
working, perform the following steps:

1. Install the fix pack on the Tivoli gateways.
2. Install the fix pack on the Inventory server.
3. Upgrade the Inventory database on the RDBMS server. 

   Note: Until you perform step 2 and 3 of the procedure, you can only
         run Inventory scans on endpoints attached to the gateways, on
         which you have not yet installed Fix Pack 1.

2.2.3 Traditional fix pack installation methods

You can install the fix pack for IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager using
any of the following different installation methods: 
*  2.2.3.1, "Installing fix packs using ISMP" 

   The InstallShield MultiPlatform (ISMP) program, which installs the
   appropriate IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager fix pack components for
   the entire Tivoli management region (Tivoli region).

*  2.2.3.2, "Installing fix packs using the Tivoli desktop" 

   A graphical user interface that you use to select the fix pack
   components to install and the target workstations on which to install
   them.

*  2.2.3.3, "Installing fix packs using the CLI" 

   Tivoli Management Framework command that you use to specify the fix
   pack components to install and the target workstations on which to
   install them from the command line interface.

*  2.2.3.4, "Installing fix packs using SIS" 

   The SIS console or SIS commands you use to specify the fix pack
   components to install and on which target workstations to install
   them.

2.2.3.1 Installing fix packs using ISMP

The InstallShield MultiPlatform (ISMP) program provides a wizard-guided
process for installing fix packs. It performs a check of the environment
and installs the prerequisites, if any, to perform the upgrade process.

This installation can be used on all platforms supported as a Tivoli
server, excluding Linux® for S/390®. It cannot be used to install the
License Management Extension or the Active Directory feature.

Note: Before starting the upgrade process, back up the object database
      on the Tivoli server.

For details about performing backup operations, see Tivoli Management
Framework: Maintenance and Troubleshooting Guide.

To upgrade your IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager environment with the
fix pack, complete the following steps: 
1. Locate the setup executable and run the following command in the root
   directory of IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager Installation CD:
   *  On Windows platforms, setup.exe -cmpatch
   *  On all other platforms, setup_$(INTERP).bin -cmpatch, where
      $(INTERP) represents the operating system on which you are
      launching the upgrade process.

2. Accept the Software License Agreement. Click Next.
3. Select the /xml fix pack directory. Click Next.
4. The actions necessary to upgrade your environment are being
   generated. When the process completes, a panel displays the fix pack
   components to install. Click Next.
5. Select one of the following depot options:

   Query when needed
            The InstallShield wizard prompts you for the location of
            product images. This option requires you to respond to a
            series of prompts during the installation process. This is
            the default setting.

   Verify local depot
            The InstallShield wizard prompts for the directory to which
            you have copied the installation images. The InstallShield
            wizard then searches all subdirectories of this directory to
            verify that all images are present. If an image is not
            found, you are prompted to provide its location. The
            installation process can then run unattended.

   Remote   Select this option if images are deployed on a managed node
            before you start the installation.

   Click Next.
6. In the Step List, select the steps that you want to run. Change the
   status of steps that you do not want to run immediately to Held.
7. Click Run All to run all steps whose status is Ready or click Run
   Next to run steps individually.

 For more information about installing using ISMP, see IBM Tivoli
Configuration Manager: Planning and Installation Guide.

2.2.3.2 Installing fix packs using the Tivoli desktop

When installing fix packs using the Tivoli desktop, the images are
located in the images subdirectory on the IBM Tivoli Configuration
Manager, Version 4.3.1 Fix Pack 1 CD 1. The Tivoli desktop can upgrade
the same product on multiple workstations sequentially.

The basic procedure for using the Tivoli desktop to upgrade a product is
as follows: 
1.  From the Tivoli desktop, select: 

   Upgrading an existing component
            Install -> Install Patch
2.  Select the media and component to be upgraded or added.
3.  Select the workstations where the component is to be upgraded or
   added.
4.  Click Install.

 For detailed information about using the Tivoli desktop to install or
upgrade products, see Tivoli Enterprise: Installation Guide.

2.2.3.3 Installing fix packs using the CLI

Use the wpatch command to install updates to existing components.

2.2.3.3.1 wpatch command

When upgrading existing components using the wpatch command, specify the
name of the index file using the file shown in Table 10. When using the
wpatch command to upgrade a product, you specify the following
information on the command line: 
*  The location of the image on the installation media.
*  The name of the index file associated with the product to be
   upgraded.
*  The workstations where the image is to be installed.

Example: 

wpatch -c CD-ROM/images -i index_file managed_node

 where:

-c CD-ROM/images
         Specifies the path to the images on the IBM Tivoli
         Configuration Manager, Version 4.3.1 Fix Pack 1 CD 1.

-i index_file
         Specifies the product installation index file to which the fix
         pack is installed.

managed_node
         Specifies the managed node on which the fix pack is installed.

If you do not specify a workstation when running the wpatch command, the
image is installed on all managed nodes in the Tivoli region where there
is a prior version of this image.

For detailed information about using the wpatch command, see Tivoli
Management Framework: Reference Manual.

2.2.3.4 Installing fix packs using SIS

When installing fix packs using Tivoli Software Installation Service,
select the fix pack component to be installed using the component name
shown in Table 10.

Tivoli Software Installation Service does not distinguish between
products and fix packs. Whether the installation image is used for an
installation or upgrade, Tivoli Software Installation Service refers to
all installation images as products.

Tivoli Software Installation Service can install multiple products on
multiple workstations in parallel. This software can install several
products on several computer systems in less time than using the
installation methods provided by Tivoli Management Framework.

The basic procedure for using Tivoli Software Installation Service to
install products is as follows:

2.2.4 Software package block (SPB) fix pack installation for GUI 
      components

To upgrade the GUI components of IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager using
the SPB fix packs on endpoints or standalone workstations, use one of
the following installation methods: 
*  2.2.4.1, "SPB Patch Installer"
*  2.2.4.2, "Software Distribution server command"
*  2.2.4.3, "Software Distribution disconnected command"

IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager, Version 4.3.1 GA package is a
prerequisite of the SPB fix packs.

To successfully install fix packs using any of these installation
methods, you must ensure that the values of the default variables
specified in the software package block correspond to the existing
installation on the workstation to be upgraded. If they do not
correspond, ensure that they are stored in the swdis.var file. If these
values were deleted from the swdis.var file, you must overwrite them at
fix pack installation time using the appropriate panel of the SPB Patch
Installer, or using the "-D" command line option (wdinstsp -D
variable=value GUI_component.spb).

The default variables for each component defined in the SPB fix packs
are listed in Table 11.

2.2.4.2 Software Distribution server command

To use this type of installation, your Tivoli environment must contain
an installation of the Software Distribution Server component, the
Software Distribution Gateway component, and at least one Tivoli
endpoint. The following steps must be performed to apply the SPB fix
pack on the targets: 
1. Create a new Profile in a Profile Manager, using the naming
   convention described in Table 12.
2. Import the SPB file provided in the new Profile.
3. Select the endpoints to which you want to distribute the fix pack.
4. Submit the installation using either the command line or the Tivoli
   desktop.

 If you need to overwrite the values of the default variables, use the
"-D" option (winstsp -D variable=value GUI_component.spb) from the
command line, or the Default Variables panel from the Tivoli desktop.

2.2.4.3 Software Distribution disconnected command

To use this type of installation, you must have the Software
Distribution Software Package Editor component installed on the
endpoint. If you need to overwrite the values of the default variables,
use the "-D" option (wdinstsp -D variable=value GUI_component.spb) from
the command line.

2.2.4.4 Software package block fix packs

Table 12 contains the names of the Fix Pack 1 software package blocks
and the names of the software profiles that must be used when using SPBs

Notes: 
1. (1) If you are installing the Software Package Editor component for
   Solaris on x86, using the Software Distribution command line, you
   must install the following prerequisite packages first: 
   a. Tivoli_JRE_SOLARIS_IX86.spb. This package is a prerequisite for
      installing the Software Package Editor GUI on Solaris 8 and
      Solaris 9.
   b. Tivoli_SWDEP_SOLARIS_IX86.spb. This is an empty package used to
      update the local catalog in accordance with the adopted SPB naming
      convention on Solaris 8, 9, and 10.

   If you are installing the SPB components using SPB_patch_installer,
   the prerequisite packages are automatically installed.
2. (2) Install these software package blocks that you find under the
   /package path to enable the Daylight Saving Time (DST) feature. It is
   not mandatory to perform this installation. If you do not install
   these software package blocks, the time stamp of log and trace files
   is not at Daylight Saving Time used by the following countries: 
   *  United States
   *  Canada
   *  Brazil
   *  Bermuda
   *  Western Australia

2.2.5 Updating the inventory schema

When you install a new fix pack, you must update the Inventory schema.

A fix pack does not necessarily contain fixes on SQL scripts and, if
present, these fixes do not necessarily apply to all database vendors.

Table 13 lists the SQL scripts to run for updating the Inventory schema:


Table 13. SQL scripts for updating the Inventory schema
+-------------------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+
|                   | Oracl |  DB2  | MSSQL | Syba | Info | DB2 | DB2 |
|                   |   e   |       |       |  se  | rmix | MVS | MVS |
|                   |       |       |       |      |      |     | cus |
|                   |       |       |       |      |      |     | tom |
+-------------------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+

| ql                |       |       |       |      |      |     |     |
+-------------------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+

Table 14 lists the SQL scripts to run for updating the Historical
Inventory schema:

+-------------------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+
|                   | Oracl |  DB2  | MSSQL | Syba | Info | DB2 | DB2 |
|                   |   e   |       |       |  se  | rmix | MVS | MVS |
|                   |       |       |       |      |      |     | cus |
|                   |       |       |       |      |      |     | tom |
+-------------------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+
| h_inv_db_431_FP01 |   X   |   X   |   X   |  X   |  X   |  X  |  X  |
| .sql              |       |       |       |      |      |     |     |
+-------------------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+

Copy the appropriate schema scripts to any system where SQL access is
available, such as the database server or the database client
workstation if the client allows SQL connectivity, to run the schema
scripts.

Notes: 
1. Error or information messages might be displayed when running the
   database scripts. Each database has unique behavior, so some messages
   can be expected.
2. The inv_db2_mvs_custom_*.sql script might contain some customizable
   variables such as: 
   *  XX_OWNER
   *  XX_STOGRP
   *  XX_DBNAME

   Descriptions for these variables can be found inside the
   inv_db2_mvs_admin.sql script.

For example, if you use DB2 and install this fix pack to update the
Inventory schema, refer to the DB2 column of Table 13 and run the
scripts identified in the table rows by X in the order specified:
1. inv_db2_431_FP01.sql
2. h_inv_db2_431_FP01.sql

Note: SQL scripts delivered with fix packs might alter the existing
      tables or columns, if you created materialized queries or views.
      Depending on the tables modified by the fix pack SQL scripts, the
      following error might occur for DB2 (and a similar error for other
      RDBMS vendors): 
      SQL0270N  Function not supported (Reason code = "21").  SQLSTATE=42997
      The error indicates dependency on MQT as explained below:
      21 A column cannot be dropped or have its length, data type, or
       nullability altered on a table which is a base table for a
       materialized query table.                                      

      To fix this problem, perform the following actions:
      1. Drop the dependent materialized query table or tables.
      2. Drop the column of the base table, or alter the length, data
         type, or nullability of this column.
      3. Recreate the materialized query table or tables.

2.2.6 Updating the inventory queries

This fix pack installation provides scripts to update inventory queries
with the new database information introduced by the fix pack. The
scripts inventory_query.sh and h_inventory_query.sh are located on the
managed nodes where the patch is installed, in the following directory:

$BINDIR/../generic/inv/SCRIPTS/QUERIES 

2.2.7 Updating the Inventory signatures and packages

If you have not already run the command winvmigrate to migrate
Configuration Manager signatures from the old SWSIGS.INI format to the
new IBM software catalog format, or if you imported the IBM software
catalog before installing Configuration Manager 4.3.1 Fix Pack 1, then
you must migrate the signatures belonging to the IBM software catalog.
To do this, after upgrading the inventory schema as described in 2.2.5,
"Updating the inventory schema", perform the following steps:
1. Download the latest IBM software catalog file from the following Web
   site:
   http://www-306.ibm.com/software/sysmgmt/products/support/IBMTivoliLicenseManager.html
2. Run the following command:
   winvmigrate -c IBM_software_catalog_file

If you plan to implement license management facilities in your
Configuration Manager environment, refer to IBM Tivoli Configuration
Manager: License Management with License Compliance Manager version 2.3.

2.2.8 Upgrading plug-ins

To upgrade plug-ins, you must run the upgrade scripts for Activity
Planner.

If you have installed 4.3.1-TIV-APM-FP0001, 4.3.1-TIV-SWDSRV-FP0001, and
4.3.1-TIV-INV-FP0001 run the following scripts located in the
$BINDIR/TME/APM/SCRIPTS directory. You must have the APM_Admin Tivoli
region authorization role to run them. 

sh reg_swd_plugin.sh -r
         Enables the Activity Planner for Software Distribution.

sh reg_inv_plugin.sh -r
         Enables the Activity Planner for Inventory.

sh reg_tl_plugin.sh -r
         Enables the Activity Planner for the Task Library.

Run the wstopapm and wstartapm commands, after running the scripts.

         <I>,name,size,description,version

         The signature file supports also the XML file format.


APAR IZ53312
         At the end of Appendix E. Installing and uninstalling Common
         Inventory Technology (CIT), add the following new section:

         Setting the CIT processes priority on Windows

         On Windows platforms, you can specify locally on each endpoint
         the priority for the different CIT processes by editing the
         cit.properties file and adding, for example, the following
         priorities:

         fscanner.changepriority=low
         swscanner.changepriority=low
         hwscanner.changepriority=low
         vpdscanner.changepriority=low

         If you want to add the priority settings directly to the
         CIT_win.spb package used to install CIT, perform the following
         steps: 
         1. Take the CIT_win.spb package from a gateway. The package is
            located under the
            ..bin/lcf_bundle.41100/lib/w32-ix86/inv/CIT/SPB directory.
         2. Using the Software Package Editor disconnected command line,
            unbuild the CIT_win.spb package by running the command: 
            wdubldsp.exe

            The command extracts a software package (.sp file) and the
            CIT files.
         3. Edit the unpacked cit.properties file and add, at the bottom
            of the file, the following lines: 
            fscanner.changepriority=low
            swscanner.changepriority=low
            hwscanner.changepriority=low
            vpdscanner.changepriority=low

            Save the file.
         4. Build the CIT_win.spb again by running the command: 
            wdbldspb.exe

             The new CIT_win.spb now includes the new cit.properties
            file with the priority settings that you set.
         5. Save the original CIT_win.spb on the gateways and store the
            new CIT_win.spb under the same directory.
         6. During the next CIT installations, on the endpoints, are
            automatically included the CIT priority settings contained
            in the cit.properties file.


APAR IZ53836
         In Appendix B. Commands in the "wqueryinv" section add the
         following note:

         

         Note: When using a Tivoli query containing views sharing the
               same TME_OBJECT_ID field and running the wqueryinv
               command against that query, the command fails with a
               parse error due to an ambiguous column reference. For
               example, if you are using an Oracle database the error
               message displayed is the following: 
               ORA-00918: column ambiguously defined

               You can run the command only with Tivoli queries where
               only one table and view have the TME_OBJECT_ID field.

         In Chapter 2. History tracking in section "Modifying history
         tracking for efficiency" replace the first bullet of the
         section with the following text:

         
         *  Exclude any history tables for which you do not want to
            gather data.

            By default, the h_database_schema.sql scripts create a table
            to correspond to every inventory table in the
            inv_database_schema.sql script that contains the attribute
            COMPUTER_SYS_ID. If there are tables for which you do not
            want to keep history tables, perform the following steps: 
            1. Create the table EXCLUDED_H_TABLES.
            2. Insert the name of the table to be disabled into the
               EXCLUDED_H_TABLES table.

             

            You can find the SQL statements for performing these
            operations in the h_inv_*_schema_431_FP01.sql script file.

         When you install IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager on Windows
         2008 platforms in Japanese language using a silent
         installation, the Tivoli Management Framework installation
         might hang. As a workaround, proceed first with the Tivoli
         Management Framework installation using Tivoli Management
         Framework CD 1. When this installation is complete, launch the
         usual IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager installation using the
         product CD 5.

         considerations".

APAR IZ44183
         Between Appendix A and Appendix B add the following new
         Appendix named "Upgrade and migration considerations".

2.3.1.4.1 Upgrade and migration considerations

This chapter describes how to upgrade Tivoli Management Framework and
the IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager components.

Tivoli Management Framework backward compatibility rules

The upgrade is based on the following Tivoli Management Framework
version 4.3.1 backward compatibility rules: 
*  Tivoli Management Framework can be upgraded from the following Tivoli
   Management Framework versions: 
   *  3.7
   *  3.7.1
   *  4.1
   *  4.1.1

*  Any application built with the following Tivoli Management Framework
   versions: 
   *  3.7
   *  3.7.1
   *  4.1
   *  4.1.1

   will continue to work on an upgraded platform, if Tivoli Management
   Framework version 4.3.1 is supported on that platform.
*  A 4.3.1 Tivoli region will support back level (3.7, 3.7.1, 4.1,
   4.1.1) managed nodes, gateways, and endpoints.
*  A 4.3.1 Tivoli region can be interconnected to a Tivoli region at
   3.7, 3.7.1, 4.1 and 4.1.1 levels. 

   Note: In these cases the new feature will not be available on the
         back level managed nodes and gateways, and on the endpoints
         attached to back level managed nodes and gateways.

Tivoli Configuration Manager backward compatibility rules

The upgrade is also based on the following IBM Tivoli Configuration
Manager 4.3.1 backward compatibility rules: 
*  You can upgrade to IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager version 4.3.1,
   starting from IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager version 4.2.2 or IBM
   Tivoli Configuration Manager version 4.2.3.
*  If you upgrade from earlier IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager
   versions, you must perform additional steps to migrate from the
   starting release to version 4.2.3 or 4.2.2.

The upgrade can be performed using the classical procedure based on
Tivoli Management Framework, the InstallShield MultiPlatform (ISMP)
installation on the supported platforms, or the Tivoli Software
Installation Service (SIS) on the supported platforms.

The IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager version 4.3.1 release does not
contain enhancements that require changes in the Inventory schema. The
Inventory schema upgrade modifies only the schema from the starting IBM
Tivoli Configuration Manager release to the latest 4.2.3 maintenance
level.

To upgrade the Inventory schema, apply the same procedure used when
installing a IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager fix pack.

The images of IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager version 4.3.1 contain all
the SQL scripts released with any 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 fix pack, up to
4.2.2-TIV-TCM-FP0006. You must run a subset of these scripts depending
on the database vendor and the starting IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager
release or fix pack.

2.3.1.4.1.1 Recommended steps for migrating large environments

To migrate large environments, it is recommended that you first upgrade
to Tivoli Management Framework 4.3.1, and then start upgrading to IBM
Tivoli Configuration Manager 4.3.1.

2.3.1.4.1.1.1 Upgrading Tivoli Management Framework

To upgrade Tivoli Management Framework, it is recommended that you use
the following order (top-down approach): 
1. Hubs (First the Tivoli server, then the managed nodes and the
   gateways)
2. Spokes (First the Tivoli server, then the managed nodes and the
   gateways)
3. Endpoints

At the end of this phase you will have the Tivoli Management Framework
infrastructure upgraded to 4.3.1 and IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager
still working at 4.2.x level.

2.3.1.4.1.1.2 Upgrading IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager

To upgrade IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager, it is recommended that you
use the following order (bottom-up approach): 
1. Spokes Tivoli Configuration Manager gateways
2. Hubs Tivoli Configuration Manager gateways
3. Spokes Tivoli Configuration Manager server
4. Hubs Tivoli Configuration Manager server
5. Database schema

If during the upgrade phase you want to run an Inventory scan from a
back level Configuration Manager server to 4.3.1 endpoints attached to
gateways on which IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager has already been
upgraded to 4.3.1, run the following command against each gateway that
has already been upgraded to Tivoli Management Framework 4.3.1: 

wlevlmeth -a gateway_name (| all) 

 The wlevlmeth utility is located under the /utils folder of the IBM
Tivoli Configuration Manager version 4.3.1 CD. Use the wlevlmeth command
to force the endpoints already upgraded to Tivoli Management Framework
4.3.1 to download binaries starting from the gateway bundles older than
the 4.3.1 ones.

To upgrade IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager, perform these steps:
1. Keep the Configuration Manager server components at back level.
2. If needed, run the commands wlevmeth -a gateway_name or wlevmeth -a
   all, depending on if you want to issue the command against a specific
   gateway or against each gateway in the Tivoli region.
3. Upgrade the Configuration Manager gateway components in your
   environment. During this phase, you can perform any Configuration
   Manager action against all the endpoints in your environment.
4. When all the gateways are upgraded, and all the endpoints are
   upgraded to Tivoli Management Framework 4.3.1, ensure that no
   Configuration Manager distributions are running.
5. Upgrade the Configuration Manager server components and the schema.
6. If you issued the wlevmeth command, run now the commands wlevmeth -r
   gateway_name or wlevmeth -r all to reset the dependency download
   mechanism. After performing these commands, the 4.3.1 endpoints are
   allowed to download binaries starting from 4.3.1 gateway bundles.
7. Check that the back level method flag has been restored by running
   wgateway gw_name get backlevel_methods. The command should return for
   each gateway the following output: 
   backlevel_methods: NULL

8. Start to perform any Configuration Manager action in the upgraded
   environment.

Notes: 
1. After upgrading the Configuration Manager server components and
   schema to 4.3.1, within a Tivoli region boundary, the 4.3.1 Inventory
   component might no longer support back level endpoints (for example
   at 3.7.x or 4.1.x level) because the database schema and scanner are
   no longer synchronized. For this reason some information, such as the
   signature software scan related data, cannot be collected, or there
   is a performance issue when trying to insert data to no longer
   existing or modified tables, such as service_info, matched_sware.
   Because these issues occur for all Configuration Manager schemas
   older than 4.2.3 Fix Pack 4, it is strongly recommended that you
   migrate all the endpoints to 4.3.1 before upgrading the Configuration
   Manager server and schema to 4.3.1.
2. Configuration Manager 4.3.1 server components change the dependency
   set. A new 3.7.x or 4.1.x endpoint, that never received an Inventory
   scan or a Software Distribution action before the Configuration
   Manager upgrade to 4.3.1, might not be able to download from the
   gateway all the necessary binaries. For this reason it is strongly
   recommended to have all new endpoints, installed after the
   Configuration Manager upgrade to 4.3.1, at Tivoli Management
   Framework 4.3.1 level. 

   You cannot perform a Fresh Install of 4.2.3 Configuration Manager
   gateway components, after upgrading to 4.3.1 Tivoli Management
   Framework on the managed nodes of your environment.

   If you cannot exclude the possibility that an old 3.7.x or 4.1.x
   endpoint connects to a Configuration Manager environment already
   migrated to 4.3.1, to minimize the impact caused by a mismatch
   between the Configuration Manager 4.3.1 schema and the 4.3.1 scanners
   we suggest that you:
   *  Disable the software signature software scan if you have a schema
      older than 4.2.3 Fix Pack 4.
   *  Disable the Service Info from the PC hardware scan section.
   *  Set to 1 the number of retries when a failure occurs when
      inserting data into the database using the wsetinvdh -r 1 command.

3. If you upgrade Configuration Manager starting from one of the
   following versions: 
   *  4.2.2
   *  4.2.3 GA level
   *  4.2.3 Fix Pack 1

   take into account that the Configuration Manager scan is performed,
   after 4.2.3 Fix Pack 2, by the Common Inventory Technology (CIT)
   component. This is a component of Tivoli Configuration Manager, which
   can be installed from the Software Distribution disconnected command
   line using SPB files. The Software Distribution disconnected command
   line and the SPB files for installing Common Inventory Technology are
   downloaded to the endpoint when the first Inventory scan is
   performed, after the upgrade of the Configuration Manager server and
   gateways to 4.3.1. During this Inventory scan, the first action that
   occurs is the Common Inventory Technology installation.

   For more details about disk space requirements, refer to IBM Tivoli
   Configuration Manager: Release Notes version 4.3.1.

    Common Inventory Technology is installed using the following default
   paths: 

   UNIX     /opt/tivoli/cit /etc/cit

   Windows  C:\Program Files\Tivoli\cit and C:\Windows\cit

   You can change the default installation path and also plan to install
   Common Inventory Technology in a more controlled way by using
   Software Distribution from the Configuration Manager server. 

   For more details about how to install Common Inventory Technology,
   refer to IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager: User's Guide for Inventory
   version 4.3.1

    Common Inventory Technology does not interact with a Tivoli
   Configuration Manager Inventory component installed before 4.2.3 Fix
   Pack 2, until it is upgraded to 4.3.1. Ensure that you plan to
   install Common Inventory Technology in a controlled way before
   upgrading to 4.3.1.
4. If you upgrade Configuration Manager starting from a version older
   than 4.2.3 Fix Pack 2, the first scan you perform on the endpoints
   fails because of a number of mismatches in the MIF file attribute,
   because the MIF file structure changed after 4.2.3 Fix Pack 2. To
   work around this problem, delete the previous *.bk* and *.mif files
   from the inv/SCAN directory before running a new scan. You can
   perform this operation by inserting the delete statements (for
   example, "rm *.bk*" or "del *.bk*") in the before scan script section
   of the InventoryConfig profile.

         section "Software problems and workarounds" subsection
         "Installation", add the following bullet: 
         *  APAR IZ51452: Silent installation of Tivoli Management
            Framework might hang on Windows 2008 platforms in Japanese
            language

            When you install IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager on Windows
            2008 platforms in Japanese language using a silent
            installation, the Tivoli Management Framework installation
            might hang.

            Workaround: Proceed first with the Tivoli Management
            Framework installation using Tivoli Management Framework CD
            1. When this installation is complete, launch the usual IBM
            Tivoli Configuration Manager installation using the product
            CD 5.
