#  Default policy method for Remote Control gateway 
#
#  This policy method determines whether or not to  
#  use the Remote Control gateway.
#  
#  Possible values:
#  NO       Do not use the Remote Control gateway.
#  YES <ManagedNode-label> <GatewayPort> <MaxSessions> IP:<IP-Port>
#           Use the specified Remote Control gateway, 
#           where:
#           <ManagedNode-label> is the name of the managed node 
#           to be used as Remote Control gateway.
#           <GatewayPort> is the TCP/IP port used by the Remote 
#           Control gateway to listen for connection request from
#           controllers.
#           <MaxSessions> is the number of Tivoli Remote Control 
#           sessions between a controller and target that the Remote 
#           Control gateway can handle on the same incoming port. 
#           The maximum value is 64.
#           <IP-Port> is the local TCP/IP port used by the Remote 
#           Control gateway to communicate with TCP/IP targets. 
#           If it has the value 0, the Remote Control gateway uses 
#           a port generated by the communication stack.
#  
#  Default value: NO
